# Relatively Speaking

A plugin to make your content's links relative. Not guaranteed to work for anyone or anything. AHEM.

This makes it so that when inside your post, when you add media for instance, the img tag renders the url to the image as /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image.jpg rather than http://domain.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image.jpg -- that's it =]

## Usage

Install, activate, and watch it go! =D

Please double check that it didn't just break all of your things.
